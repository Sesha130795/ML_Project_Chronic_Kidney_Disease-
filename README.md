This is a small ML project on the UCI ML repository to classify Chronic Kidney Disease. 
The notebook first has EDA analysis followed by model creation manually using sciit and also using automation with the pycaret library.
Finally a simple streamlit based deployment script is written which is used to create an interactive GUI.
